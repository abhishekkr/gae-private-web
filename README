Pre-requisite: Python >= v2.5

~~~~~ HOW TO USE ~~~~~

goto Dashboard of your GoogleAppEngine APP,
under link 'Permission' from Right-Menu-Column
the URL-Box link would look like: 
https://appengine.google.com/permissions?app_id=s%7E$GAE_APPLICATION_NAME

now, invite all those user's by providing their
e-mail ID and changing their role to 'Viewer' 

#git clone git://github.com/abhishekkr/gae-private-web.git

#cd gae-private-web

#python private_flat.py $GAE_APPLICATION_NAME

#cp -r $MY_STATIC_CONTENT_DIR/* $GAE_APPLICATION_NAME/flat_web/

now, you can update the created dir $GAE_APPLICATION_NAME to AppEngine,
by executing following command from downloaded AppEngine's Python SDK

#python appcfg.py update $PATH_TO{$GAE_APPLICATION_NAME}
